# gdb-dataplugins

This was an experiment in adding data visualization plugins to GDB.

The long, technical explanation and pitch to the GDB mailing list can
be read [in the list archives](https://sourceware.org/pipermail/gdb-patches/2008-August/059425.html).

It actually worked pretty well, but when I presented it to the GDB
mailing list, they said "we're embedding Python, which solves
this problem, too."  :(

I'm leaving this repository here, archived, for history's sake, but
this is a version of GDB from 2008 and hasn't been touched since the
initial proof of concept.
